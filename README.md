# **Coder's Hangman** 
 
## Purpose of the project
Coder's Hangman is a terminal based game designed to give students something fun, absorbing and easy to do while they take a quick break from coding. It also allows them to keep familiarising themselves with code-based vocabulary while they taking a break from actual coding.

## **Planning Stage**
### **Intended Users**
* The intended user is any student or programmer who needs to take a quick break from a piece of code that might be causing them problems.
* The user would rather take a quick micro-break from the code for a few mintues in order not to lose focus on the problem completely, but needs a bit of a reset in orde to focus on it. 

### **User Stories**
 * As a visiting user, I want to play a game of hangman.
 * As a user I want to know how many letters are in the word.
 * As a user, I want to know whether my guess is correct and to see its position in the word. 
 * As a user, I want to know when my guess is incorrect.
 * As a user I want to know which letters I've already guessed.
 * As a user, I want to know how many lives I have left before I lose.

### **Site aims**
* To show the user a word with blank spaces indicating the number of letters.
* To inform the user when their guess is correct and display the letter in the correct position in the word.
* To inform the user when their guess is incorect and visually represent their incorrect guesses with the hangman.
* To display a list of previously guessed letters to the user.
* To inform the user how many lives they have left before each guess.

 ### **FlowChart**
 The following flowchart acted as the blueprint for the game.
 I used this to visualize the steps as they would be required in the code.
